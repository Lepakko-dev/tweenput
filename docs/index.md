This is the documentation for [Tweenput], a [Godot] addon that unifies the official Tween class of Godot with a simple Quick Time Event system in a text-based scripting language that dynamically creates and updates Tweens.

This is still a W.I.P. so most concepts are to be explained and expanded in the future, but at least the documentation is no longer in the README...
